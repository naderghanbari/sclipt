Sclipt
======
Sclipt is an attempt to use Scala as a Scripting Language. 

Functional nature of Scala - or functional parts of its nature - can be a powerful asset when writing scripts.

Usage
-----
Check the `bin` directory inside which you can find a bunch of executable files which are links to actual scripts in `src` folder.
Each script file starts with a shebang line and a short description of what it does as a script.

Disclaimer
----------
As mentioned before, this is just a showcase. Feel free to use it anywhere, but at your own risk.

Scala version
-------------
Scala `2.11` or later.
