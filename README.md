# Sclipt
Sclipt is a showcase of Scala Programming Language as a Scripting Language. 

We believe that functional nature of Scala - or functional part of scala nature, as it is also an
object oriented language - can be a powerful asset in the field of writing scripts.

## Usage
Check the `bin` directory inside which you can find a bunch of executable files. Each file starts with a shebang
line and a short description of what it does as a script.

## Scala version
Scala `2.10` or later.
